# Accounts_Delivery_Networking_Small_Project




Based on the case study, I created a small networking project to show how two distinct organizational departments are connected.




Case Study :-




Design a network in cisco packet tracer to connect ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY department through the following points:



1) Each department should contain atleast 2 PCs.




2) Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.




3) Using the given network address 192.168.40.0, all interfaces should be configured with appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.




4) All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.




5) Test the connectivity between ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY department - PCs in DELIVERY department should be able to ping the PCs in ACCOUNTS department. 









Technologies Implemented :- 





1) Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.





2) Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.







3) Connecting two Networks using a Router.







4) Subnetting and IP Addressing.







5) Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.








6) Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.








7) Test and Verifying Network Communication.



POV : Additionally, I used a router and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to dynamically assign IP addresses to hosts and endpoints in both sub-networks.
